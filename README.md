# Godot Flash Animation

The plugin can bring Flash animations into Godot.

1. Use
    Download the Flash conversion tool from the following link:  
   [Swf Tool](https://github.com/aojiaoxiaolinlin/swf_animation)

    Use a packing tool that can save file names. I have only tested with **Texture Packer**.

    After importing both this plugin and the packing tool plugin, enable the plugins. Then, create a new **SwfAnimation** node, and attach the generated `*.json` animation file resource to the node's **Animation Data** property.
